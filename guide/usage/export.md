# Data export

You can export records directly from the DataView toolbar. The export respects
the active search filter — only matching records are exported.

## How to export

1. Open the record list for the desired table.
2. Optionally apply a search filter to limit the export.
3. Click the **Export** button in the toolbar.
4. Choose the format: **CSV**, **XLSX** or **JSON**.
5. The file downloads immediately — no temp file is created on the server.

## Formats

| Format | Notes |
|---|---|
| **CSV** | Comma-separated values, UTF-8 encoded. Suitable for Excel, Google Sheets, R, Python. |
| **XLSX** | Native Excel file. Column headers in row 1. |
| **JSON** | Array of objects, one per record. Field names as keys. |

## What is exported

The export includes **all columns** of the main table (not plugin sub-tables).
The column order matches the [field order](/guide/setup/adding-columns) defined in Config.

Plugin table data (e.g. finds attached to a context) is not included in the main
export. Export the plugin table separately by selecting it as the active table.

## Large datasets

Exports are **streamed** directly to the browser — there is no server-side temp file
and no memory ceiling. Exports of hundreds of thousands of records are supported.
