# Command palette

The **command palette** is a keyboard-first way to jump anywhere in the
application or run a quick action, without navigating through the sidebar.
Open it with **Ctrl+K** (**Cmd+K** on macOS) from any screen, or click the
search icon in the top bar.

## How to use

1. Press **Ctrl+K** / **Cmd+K** (or click the search icon in the top bar).
2. Start typing — results are filtered as you type, grouped into
   **Navigation**, **Tables**, and **Actions**.
3. Use the **arrow keys** to move the highlighted selection, **Enter** to run
   it, **Esc** to close.
4. Clicking a result with the mouse works too.

Typing a table name jumps straight to its record list — the fastest way to
answer "show me all records in table X".

## Actions that need a table

A few commands act on a specific table (e.g. *New record in…*, *Open Harris
Matrix for…*). Selecting one of these keeps the palette open and narrows the
list down to tables only — pick one to complete the action. Press **Esc** to
step back to the full list instead of picking a table.

Available parametric actions:

| Action | What it does |
|---|---|
| New record in… | Opens a blank record for the chosen table |
| Open Harris Matrix for… | Only offered for tables with the [Harris Matrix (RS) plugin](/guide/system-plugins/rs) enabled |
| Open chronology for… | Only offered for tables with the [Fuzzy date plugin](/guide/system-plugins/fuzzy-date) enabled |
| Open map for… | Available for every table |

## What shows up depends on your privilege

The palette only ever offers destinations and actions your account is
actually allowed to use — the same rule the sidebar follows. If something you
expect is missing (e.g. *System configuration*, *Free SQL*), it's because
your [user privilege](/guide/setup/users) doesn't grant it, not a bug.

::: tip
The palette also exposes a couple of things that have no sidebar entry at
all, like switching dark mode or language directly from the keyboard.
