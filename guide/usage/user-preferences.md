title: User preferences
---

Each user can customize itsproper experience with Bradypus and these features are collected in the 
**User preferences** module located in the main page.


User preferences can be session related or can be saved to the database and loaded each time the 
user logs in and thus make them permanent.

Once a preference is changed, the **Save** button of the **Save** panel will save the 
change in the database and make it persistent through work sessions. If a change is not
saved in the database it will be "forgotten" and resetted on logout.

## Result pagination
The listing of a query results will never show by default all the available found, since
these can be sereval thousands or millions and it would be highly inefficient to show all items.

Bradyus paginates results, by splitting them in groups of 30 items. You can change this behaviour
and activate Infinite scrolling. Results will still be divided in pages, but new pages will
be automatically loaded in results table as the user scrolls down (or up) the results.
