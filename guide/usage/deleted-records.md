# Deleted records

When a record is deleted in BraDypUS, it is **soft-deleted** — the data is not
immediately erased but kept as a snapshot that can be reviewed and restored.

Open **Deleted records** from the sidebar.

## Browsing deleted records

1. Select the **Table** from the dropdown.
2. The list shows all soft-deleted records for that table, with the deletion
   timestamp and the user who deleted them.
3. Click a row to preview the record's last known field values.

## Restoring a record

Click **Restore** next to a deleted record. A confirmation dialog appears.
After confirmation:

- The record is recreated with all its previous field values.
- A new `restore` entry is added to the [version history](/guide/usage/versions).
- The record becomes immediately visible in the normal record list.

::: warning Admin required
Restoring deleted records requires admin privilege.

## Permanent deletion

There is no automatic purge. Snapshots of deleted records are kept in
`bdus_versions` indefinitely — a deleted record remains restorable for
as long as its snapshot row exists.

To permanently remove a deleted record and make it irrecoverable, a
database administrator must manually delete its row(s) from `bdus_versions`.
There is no in-app UI for this operation.
