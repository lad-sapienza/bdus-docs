title: Publishing to Infinityfree
---

::: warning Outdated guide
This page was written for BraDypUS v4 and describes deployment to a free shared
PHP host. The steps may still work for the PHP backend (`bdus-api`) on similar
hosts, but the Vue frontend (`bdus-app`) must be built separately and uploaded
as static files. Consider using the [Docker-based deployment](/guide/deploy/) instead.
:::

::: info
The choice of Infinityfree for this demo is based on a **non-exhaustive** search
for free PHP hosting. There are likely better alternatives.
The free plan of Infinityfree **is not** suitable for production, but works for
testing purposes.

## Create the service

In order to upload an application it is necessary to
create and activate a service.  
The free account can host up to three free services.

2.1. Once logged in, in the `Accounts` tab, click on **Create account**

2.2. Insert the third-level domain of your choise in the field **Subdomain**.
This is the web address whete the application will be published.  
The first and second level domain can not be customized in the free version. 
You can chooese between `epizy.com` and `rd.gd`. 
Clicking on **Search Domain** will launch a search to verify that the 
subdomain is available.

2.3. After, you will be asked for a descriptive label to add to the service (this is optional)
and a secure password that will be used for all the nex operations. 
The username will be automatically generated.

2.4. Once the service has been created, it will take some time before
it is available on the Web. It can take up tu 72 hours before it can be 
reached at the provided address (reported in the upper part of the page).  
In the left page is reported the application status. When it is **Active**
it means that we can go ahead and publish our application. We will also
be alerted by an email message when the service is on and ready.  
In the right part of the page are located the necessary information
for the FTP connection and the file upload. We will use
[FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) for this.  
The paswoord is hidden and you should clink on **Show/Hide** 
to visualize it.  
We can upload our application, while qe are waiting for the 
[DNS propagation](https://infinityfree.net/support/why-doesnt-my-domain-work/).

# Upload the files

[FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) is one of the most well-known 
softwares for the FTP protocol. It is open-sourced and available for Windows, 
MacOS e many Linux distros.

To connect to a remore server, we need few information:
- The hostname
- A username
- A password
- eventually the port number, if different frm the default 21.

3.1. We enter these information in the upper part of the application window
and click on **Quick connect**.

3.2. After few seconds we should be connected and we should be able to see
in the right part of the application window the content of the remote server,
and in the left the local one.  
Browse your file system on the felft and reach the BraDypUS directory.  
On the right open the `htdocs` directory, that in many systems is
the default name of the web publised path.

3.3. Select all file and folders on the left, right click and select **Upload**.  
The upload proccess will start, and depending on the connectionn speed will take
a minitute or more to complete.  
In the lower part of the screen it will be possible to follow
the upload queue and progress.

3.4. When the queue is finisged, the upload process is complete,
and both sides of the screen should show the same content.

3.5. When the DNS propagation has ended, we will find in the choosen web address
